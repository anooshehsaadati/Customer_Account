# Customer_Account
This project is about Customer Account and has a REST API webservice.

Before the interview, I must implement some project.
I drew the ER Graph on https://www.mural.co. This is about the Customer and Account Table and has 2 webservices for CRUD operations (CustomerService - AccountService).

    Use JDBC to connect to the database.
    Use Log4j2 for log operations.
    Use Javadoc for documentation.
    Handle all exceptions.

I categorized the project with packages.
